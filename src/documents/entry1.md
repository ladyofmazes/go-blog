## About Me

Conflicting reports exist.

Potentially a lifelong wife and mother of three.

Alternatively a member of the CIA and/or founder of a cult.

In extreme cases some sort of nightmare elder god,

the likes of which humanity can not even conceive,

older than the stars and all that humanity holds dear,

an endless wandering emptiness with depthless hunger,

attempting to modify and then devour all existence,

stymied but patient, ever so patient.

Or I may just be a trans masc non-binary person who lives

with my sister, our dog and two cats and answers support tickets

only half of which are caused by things that I created
